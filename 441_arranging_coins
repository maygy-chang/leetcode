441. Arranging Coins
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
Example 1:
  Input: n = 5
  Output: 2 
  Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:
  Input: n = 8
  Output: 3
  Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
