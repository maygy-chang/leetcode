76. Minimum Window Substring
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring
 of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
在S中找出包含T的全部字符的最小子串。
統計字符出現的個數，而且時間複雜度要求O(N)，明顯使用雙指針解題。
Example 1:
  Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
  Output: "BANC"
  Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:
  Input: s = "a", t = "a"
  Output: "a"
  Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:
  Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
  Output: ""
  Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
  Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
